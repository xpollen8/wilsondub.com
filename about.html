	<b>How It All Went Wrong</b>
	<p>
	I started the Wilson project fondly imagining that it would be
	a solo thing.
	<p>I figured that I could use my computer to make backing tracks
	for me to play along with, and thus get around the stunted expectations
	and inexorable tedium which normally attend the appearance of
	a man in his forties sitting on a stool with a guitar in his
	lap.
	<p>Largely taking the Great <a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/conspirators/wolfgang_tschegg">Wolfgang Tschegg</a> my example, I thought
	that I might be able to present my songs in an interesting fashion,
	one which might afford me the opportunity to sit back and really
	play, rather than just holding down the basic tune with endless
	rhythm guitar strumming. I committed myself to doing a gig (in
	order to have a deadline) and set to cooking up some groovy backing
	tracks. 
	<p>A month or so later I had the bones of a set. I had built nice
	easy tunes, which would afford me a bit of space to stretch out
	and do something, and I had begun to figure out a few nice ideas
	for songs. 
	<p>Somewhere around this point, my pal <a href="people.html#russ">Russ</a>, who played percussion
	for <a href="https://sumosonic.com">Sumosonic</a> and on <a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/releases/rotten">Rotten Soul</a>, decided that he would help out at the gig. I agonized for a
	while before I decided that in that case we might as well get
	a bassist too. One night I was in a bar, looking for Aggi, who
	played the bass for Sumosonic. He seemed like a pretty obvious
	choice. I never did find Aggi, but I did run into Russ, who was
	with our friend Kathy Schaer a.k.a. Special K, one time Sumo
	vocalist. Rather to my astonishment it was announced to me that
	Kath was to be our bass player.
	<p>I had seen Kath hold her own on bass alongside Jonny Mattock
	and Mark Refoy, so I knew that she was good enough for the job.
	The three of us decided to style ourselves a "low power trio",
	and it was as such that we rehearsed and performed our first
	show at The Soundhaus in Northampton on <a href="gigs/2001/Mar1.html">
	1st March 2001</a>. Along
	the way we tried to work up a sort of ascetic dub sound, with
	grungey loops, phat bass and sparse, loud guitar, largely tuned
	to a single chord for maximum drone simplicity. 
	<p>There were definite advantages in being in band where all the
	members lived within five minutes
	walk of each others
	front doors. Everyone had an income and two of the three of
	us had cars. Logistically it was already the best group I had
	ever been in. After the Soundhaus gig we played at
	<a href="gigs/2001/Apr1.html">The Racehorse</a>
	in Northampton and then went on the road to play
	<a href="gigs/2001/Apr14.html">in Leeds</a> for
	Team Borscht. Each time we played we enjoyed ourselves more and
	people were responding well.
	<p>As we entered May 2001 events came to pass which caused me to
	suspect that perhaps people were responding a little too well.
	My good friend Ian Botterill, the singer from Sumo and Fat Controller,
	came asking to join the band, bringing with him another guitarist,
	<a href="gigs/2002/Jan31.html"><img
		src="images/2002Jan31/Boatrace_250.jpg" width=250 height=166
		alt="big-ass image" border=1 align="right" hspace="5"></a>
	Steve Gordon, from the gargantuan Northampton funk collective
	P-Hex. Bearing in mind that I had just found out how much fun
	it can be to be the only guitarist in a band, I was a touch uncertain
	as to how all this would work out. Matters were further complicated
	within the week. Sitting in my back yard one day, <a href="people.html#curt">Curtis</a>
	asked me: 
	"Can anyone be in your band? Can I be in your band?"
	"Of course you can be in my band, Curt,"
	I replied, 
	"Just as long as you play the Theremin!"
	<p>I figured that this was just the sort of reply the facetious
	old bastard was expecting.
	<p>It certainly was not what I was expecting when Curtis turned
	up a few days later with something that, while not technically
	a Theremin, was nonetheless quite clearly a Theremin! The 
	"Air-FX"
	is a device made for DJs. By moving one's hand over a series of invisible
	beams emanating from the Air-FX
	one can manipulate a whole rake of mad synthesised sounds, and
	even start to affect the final mix, dropping filters and all
	manner of other tricks. In our pal's music shop they are advertised thus: 
	"QUICK! BUY ONE OF THESE! THEY'RE MENTAL!"
	<p>I had to admit it. In the course of one week our band had doubled
	in size.
	<p>Our first date as a sextet came at the end of May. We found ourselves
	headlining a four band bill
	<a href="gigs/2001/May24.html">at The Racehorse</a>. Immediately before
	us came Capdown (short for "Capitalist Downfall", fact fans!),
	a profoundly talented and effective ska/punk band
	with a new album and a slot at Reading Festival. It looked as
	though it would be a fairly pointless exercise trying to follow
	something like that, but we went ahead with it and it all went
	off very well. Capdown certainly seemed to enjoy it. So one after-show
	party later there we were, a fully functioning six-piece. And
	I had to admit that Steve's guitar really did bring something to the sound. As readers
	of this will probably know, I've been lucky enough to have worked with
	some really fine guitarists
	over the years, so I'm not being idle when I say that Steve is one of the most intuitive
	and sensitive players I have worked with. He is not flash or
	fancy, but he always seems to know exactly what will work in
	a situation.
	<p>Wilson was quiet over the Summer while I travelled with the <a href="http://www.jazzbutcher.com" target="new">JBC</a>,
	but we picked up again in September. We played another
	<a href="gigs/2001/Oct19.html">show in Leeds</a>,
	picking up a nice bit of press in the northern edition
	of The Big Issue. We did a
	<a href="gigs/2001/Oct7.html">series of shows</a> at
	<a href="gigs/2001/Dec2.html">The Racehorse</a> in
	Northampton, drawing larger audiences each time we played out.
	Given that almost everyone in the band has another band, it took
	quite a while for people to realise exactly what was going on.
	By the time that we played our
	<a href="gigs/2001/Dec24.html">Christmas Eve show</a> it seemed that
	we had established ourselves an identity locally. 
	<p>The autumn also saw Ian, Curtis and me getting seriously into
	the business of writing and assembling our music in our own studio.
	Over a few months we developed a massive library of sounds and
	samples and worked it into some half a dozen new tunes. In January
	Ian moved his computer equipment into the studio, which now operates
	like a small factory, with three men working six hours a day
	most every day. I can honestly say that I have not worked in
	a more exciting and creative environment.
	<p><a href="gigs/2002/Jan31.html">In January</a> (2002) Wilson played
	with <a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/conspirators/gabriel_turner">Garbriel Turner</a>'s band, Tobermory, in Cambridge.
	<p>Up until this night I was very happy with the band's music, but I was concerned
	that maybe we were a bit disorganised
	and unimpressive vocally. This was the night that the singing
	and shouting caught up with the playing. Curtis, Ian and I travelled
	the 50-odd miles to the gig in a car together, screaming our
	heads off and singing like lunatics the whole way. There is no
	doubt in my mind that this had something to do with our performance
	that evening. Wilson entered 2002... more confident and intimidating than ever before.
